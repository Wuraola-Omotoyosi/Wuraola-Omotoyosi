# Create a game that asks the user to guess a rock or a mineral based on the clues given. Give them three tries to get it right. If they get it right, congratulate them. If they get it wrong, tell them what the answer is.

# #Clues to be given will be
# #1.grain Size
# #2.silica content
# #3.color
# #4.grain shape

# #Ultramafic rocks: These contain very low silica content (less than 45%). They are rich in iron and magnesium. Examples include peridotite and komatite.
# #Mafic rocks: These have moderate silica content (45-55%). They are also rich in iron and magnesium. Basalt and gabbro are common mafic rocks1.
# #Intermediate rocks: These fall between mafic and felsic compositions (55-65% silica). Andesite is a well-known intermediate rock1.
# #Felsic rocks: These have high silica content (more than 65%). They are rich in potassium, sodium, and aluminum. Granite and rhyolite are examples of felsic rocks
